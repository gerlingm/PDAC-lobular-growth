Tested with R 4.1.1, R 4.1.2 for Mac but should run without problems on other R versions and OS. 
The code was updated during Revision #1 with R version 4.4.1, in Rstudio 2024.09.0 on macOS 15.4.1.

The aim of this computational pipeline is to combine and explore annotations on clinically stained IHC and addtional manual stainings of IF, and associated data from pancreatic cancer.

The quantitative data are provided in the folder "source data files to read in", where the file to read in matches the script file.

R studio can be downloaded from https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/, and R is proveded at https://cran.r-project.org.

A detailed guide for setting up R and Rstudio can be found at https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html. The estimated time to install R and Rstudio should be <1 hour.

This readme file and the repository will be updated constantly and finalized upon acceptance of an associated scientific manuscript, which will present the expected output. Expect install time and run time 4 hours.
